# Hackathon
All the hackathons I will participate in

First Hackathon I participated in: "GreenLife Hackathon" Held by University Transilvania and 
Activize Tech. 

Me and my team managed to win second place. 
We had to create a business plan and present it in 3 minutes (Pitch Workshop). 

You can see more details about our business idea and the team in the pdf file.

I learned: 

- To work under pressure
- To work in a team
- To design a business plan
- Present a project in front of a public
- Marketing strategy
- How to get investments for our idea
